    <string name="AppInfo">This simple to do list app is the first real android app, I have
        developed. If you have problems with the app or you want features to be added don\'t
        hesitate to contact me. The app is completely free and without ads and should only provide
        basic functionality. Personally, I find that many to do list apps in the playstore are either
        overloaded with ads, features like synchronisation to the cloud etc or in most cases both.
        However if you like the app and find it usefull, please consider rating it on Google Play.

        Have fun with the app \n
